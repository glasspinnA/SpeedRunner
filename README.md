Purpose of this game is to use some sort of EEG helmet to measure the users brain activity in order to control the game. The ideas is when the brain activity of the player reaches a certain threshold should he or her make the player in game to jump.  

This is game inspired by Google Chrome offline T-rex game (https://chromedino.com/).
